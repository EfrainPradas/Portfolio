4. Features
Some information about the data:
We are dealing with images (unstructured data) so it is probably best we use deep learning / transfer learning.
There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
There are around 10000 + images in the training set with labels.
There are 10000+ images in the test set with no labels, because we will predict it.
